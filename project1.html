                    This was a team project for IAT334 Fall 2023, this project was done in teams of 3.

                    I was the lead UI/UX designer for this project, and came with the name “kin” for the app.

                               they like blue color more than the orange and we decided to go with that moving forward.

For the home page, I added affordances such as the image bleeding of the page to give users an indication that more content is present there and they can swipe it, same with the today section at the bottom of the page. I also added a “+” button for adding family members which can be easily accessed and adding people from there is pretty simple too.
