                    A solo project done for an online UI/UX Design competition in Summer 2023. <br>
                    The purpose of the project was to create something that you would be proud of and come up with design quickly.<br> 
                    The design competition was a rapid fire one which only lasted for 4 days.<br>
                    I decided to make an app related to scuba diving as it seemed something I would want to do in the future.

                                What is so hard about dive planning? With this question in mind, I conducted interviews with professional freedivers to gain insight into their experiences and discover ways in which the diving process could be improved                               </li>

                            <b>Unique and Cohesive Design:</b> <br> I wanted to designed the app in such a way that the users would understand what to do just by looking. For the home page, I added affordances such as the image bleeding of the page to give users an indication that more content is present there and they can swipe it, same with the today section at the bottom of the page. I also added a “+” button for adding family members which can be easily accessed and adding people from there is pretty simple too.

                        the help of tutorials I was able to overcome this challenge.
