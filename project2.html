                    The purpose of the project was to create something that you would be proud of and come up with design quickly.<br> 
                    The design competition was a rapid fire one which only lasted for 4 days.<br>
                    I decided to make an app related to scuba diving as it seemed something I would want to do in the future.

                                The process of planning requires careful consideration of factors such as weather, tides, diving partner, and more... each categories takes great efforts to plan. I came to wonder, how can we improve diving process?
                                What is so hard about dive planning? With this question in mind, I conducted interviews with professional freedivers to gain insight into their experiences and discover ways in which the diving process could be improved                               </li>

                            <b>Interactive & Simple:</b> <br> After gaining some initial insights into the diving process, I decided to attend freediving classes to deepen my understanding and experience about the situation.
                            The process roughly goes like: Plan -> Dive -> Review. While there are many steps and procedures involved in each of these phases, I learned that one of the most crucial aspects of diving is monitoring weather and environmental conditions.
                            Divers should check on weather, environment information frequently, and observe the tide pattern before going into the water.
